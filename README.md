# ReminderRemake
Remake of Avimark Reminders via Visual Basic
AVImark Reminder Logic – Visual Basic (.NET)

Overview:

This project is a standalone Visual Basic .NET Windows Forms application that recreates the reminder logic workflow commonly found in AVImark veterinary practice management software. The focus of the project is on conditional logic and reminder scheduling behavior based on prior user input.

Disclaimer:

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to AVImark or Covetrus. It is an independent educational and portfolio project inspired by observed reminder behavior. This is a logic and workflow remake intended for learning and demonstration purposes only.

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how reminder systems determine future reminders based on previous actions and selected intervals. It also serves as practice translating real-world veterinary software workflows into Visual Basic code. Key concepts include conditional logic, event-driven programming, and increment-based scheduling.

Features:

User input for reminder parameters
Interval selection (weekly, monthly, yearly)
Conditional logic to determine next reminders
Dynamic calculation of reminder dates
Clear output displaying reminder results

Technologies Used:

Language: Visual Basic .NET
Framework: Windows Forms
IDE: Visual Studio
Platform: Windows

How It Works:

The user enters required information such as name, age, and reminder interval.
Reminder options are selected using form controls.
The application evaluates the inputs using If / ElseIf / Else logic.
The next reminder is calculated based on the selected increment and previous input.
The result is displayed to the user.

Limitations:

No database or persistent storage
No integration with real veterinary software systems
Simplified logic for clarity and learning


Project Status:

Complete as an educational and portfolio project.
